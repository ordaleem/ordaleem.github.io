<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jul/17/neoliberalism-has-conned-us-into-fighting-climate-change-as-individuals">Great little article</a> about the ineffectiveness of fighting systems of power (in this case climate change) with consumer choices.</p>
<p>"Steeped in a culture telling us to think of ourselves as consumers instead of citizens, as self-reliant instead of interdependent, is it any wonder we deal with a systemic issue by turning in droves to ineffectual, individual efforts?"</p>
<p>What's needed is what's <a href="https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/">outlined here</a>: WWII-scale climate mobilization.</p>
