<p>I made a module from a slightly modified MFOS circuit. It's all <a href="http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&amp;PROJARG=ENVELOPE_FOLLOWER/efpg2.html&amp;VPW=1120&amp;VPH=705">over there</a> (just the U1 bit of the "Envelope Follower Filter") but I'll share this schematic just to show what pot values and such worked for me. Gotta love that inverted out.<br /><br />
