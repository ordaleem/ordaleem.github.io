This is a 4-output resistive touch controller I developed originally based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT6nZsixP0M">this video here</a>.
</p><p>
It works by passing 12V through your finger (you'll be fine), into some capacitors, dropping the voltage, and buffering it. Pretty simple! As you can see in the pictures I put masking tape behind the touch sensors to keep them from the grounded panel. And the holes were drilled bigger than the threads, again to avoid contact.</p><p>
Since making this module I've upgraded from using sharpie to toner transfer for etching, so I decided to revisit this layout and update it. For us. The new layout is about half the size and way less ugly!</p><p>

Here's <a href="/assets/2021/toucher-copper.pdf">the copper layer</a>,<br />
and <a href="/assets/2021/toucher-silk.pdf">the silkscreen</a>.
</p><p>
These are at 600dpi. And <a href="/assets/2021/toucher-schem.pdf">here's the schematic</a>. Take note of the 100ks from V+ to the touchpads--they're not on the PCB.</p>
