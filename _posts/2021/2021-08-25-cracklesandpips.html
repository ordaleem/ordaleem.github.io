These are two circuits that sound great and are relatively simple to build. It's fun to play with layout/container, switches and pots.</p><p>

<a href="https://www.eam.se/kraakdoos/">Here's</a> where I found the original schematic for the cracklebox. Starve pots are highly recommended. I'd also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAOPvYRIo8">this album</a> by Michel Waisvisz, inventor of the cracklebox, made only with "cracklesynths".</p><p>

The pipsqueak is from <a href="https://mroztronium.blogspot.com/">Martin Freeman</a> and is a spiritual successor to the cracklebox--a digital noise box made with more readily available components (I bought some knockoff ICs for the crackleboxes). <a href="https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/download/file.php?id=39707">Here</a> is the circuit, and <a href="https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=167041&hilit=cracklebox">here</a> is the forum thread I found it on.</p><p>
