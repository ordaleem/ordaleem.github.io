<p>"What are you looking for in these lands of dependent transformation? The Buddha-Dharma is just so much waste paper to wipe off privy filth. The Buddha is a phantom body, the ancestors just old monks. The true Buddha has no figure, the true Dharma no form. All you are doing is devising models and patterns out of phantoms." --Lin Chi in 9th Century China</p>
