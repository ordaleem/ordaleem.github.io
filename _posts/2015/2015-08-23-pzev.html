<p>Driving around I've been seeing a lot of PZEV namepates with "Partial Zero-Emissions Vehicle" underneath. It's a strange term (how can something be partially nothing?) so I decided to do some amateur research which lead me to another funny acronym: SULEV or "Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle". What are these people 12!?</p>
<p>And to compound the silliness you have the fact that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car">the creation of new vehicles produces as much or more pollution than the vehicle itself will over its entire life</a>...</p>
