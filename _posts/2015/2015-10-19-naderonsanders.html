<p>"Bernie Sanders should tell the millions of voters watching the 'debates' that local socialism is as American as apple pie, going back to the 18th Century, by mentioning post offices, public highways, public drinking water systems, public libraries, public schools, public universities, and public electric companies as examples." --Ralph Nader</p>
