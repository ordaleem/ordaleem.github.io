<p>Just spent a minute watching <a href="https://guide.handmade-seattle.com/c/2022/weathering-software-winter/">this</a> wonderful and inspiring talk from Devine of <a href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">hundred rabbits</a>. Boat punk nerds. It really got the juices flowing around doing things the slow hard way, and the importance of autonomy and curiosity. </p>
<p>All the technical stuff went far over my head but I like that. Also the pictures were pretty.</p>
