<p>From <a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/stand-against-suffering/">this article</a>: "The dharma is not an excuse to turn away from the suffering of the world, nor is it a sedative to get us comfortably through painful times. It is a powerful teaching that frees and strengthens us to work diligently for the liberation of beings from suffering."</p>
