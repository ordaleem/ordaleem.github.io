<p><a href="https://nozeninthewest.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/private-religion-private-engagement-communal-religion-communal-engagement/">Here</a> is a nice little article at <a href="https://nozeninthewest.wordpress.com/">No Zen in the West</a> about the tension between the personal and communal aspects of buddhist practice and how they play into the political sphere. I've observed a dangerous inclination for some zen practitioners to be sort of new-agey and have a hands off approach to politics and this article speaks to it well.</p>
