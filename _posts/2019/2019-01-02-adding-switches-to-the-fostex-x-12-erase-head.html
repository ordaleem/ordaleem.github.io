<p>I've been making cassette tape loops recently, which necessitates disabling the erase head while recording. Constantly placing and removing a tiny sliver of tape and aluminum foil over the erase head got tedious quick. I've added 4 switches to turn on or off the erase head for each of the four tracks.</p>
<p><a href="https://synthhacker.blogspot.com/2014/02/portastudio-defeating-erase-head.html">Here</a> is an article that goes into more detail. It only posits the wiring though, and after some more research I learned that ideally there is a dummy load so the voltage that would've gone to the erase head doesn't go somewhere else, potentially messing with biases.</p>
<p>SO. Ground wires to the erase head (black on the Fostex X-12) were left in place and the SPDT switches are also wired to a separate erase head that is taped inside the case. Here's my crappy diagram of the erase head wires:</p>
