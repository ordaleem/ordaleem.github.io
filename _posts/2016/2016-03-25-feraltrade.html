<p>I saw a talk the other day by the founder of <a href="http://www.feraltrade.org/cgi-bin/courier/courier.pl">feral trade</a>, a grocery and shipping business organized only through personal social networks, and with a completely open supply chain (which makes for a pretty fun website to explore). It's a bizarre, inspiring, and very interesting model for business and art!</p>
<p>From their <a href="http://www.feraltrade.org/statement/">about page</a>:</p>
<p>Feral Trade is a grocery business and public experiment, trading goods over social networks. The word 'feral' describes a process which is willfully wild (as in pigeon) as opposed to romantically or nature-wild (wolf). The passage of goods can open up wormholes between diverse social settings, routes along which other information, techniques or individuals can potentially travel. [Goods are traded] over social, cultural and occupational networks; harnessing the surplus freight potential of existing travel (friends, colleagues, passing acquaintances) for the practical circulation of goods.</p>
