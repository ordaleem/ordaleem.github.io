<p>I've built a grass hut where there's nothing of value.<br />
After eating, I relax and enjoy a nap.<br />
When it was completed, fresh weeds appeared.<br />
Now it's been lived in - covered by weeds.</p>
<p>The person in the hut lives here calmly,<br />
Not stuck to inside, outside, or in between.<br />
Places worldly people live, he doesn't live.<br />
Realms worldly people love, he doesn't love.</p>
<p>Though the hut is small, it includes the entire world.<br />
In ten square feet, an old man illumines forms and their nature.<br />
A Great Vehicle bodhisattva trusts without doubt.<br />
The middling or lowly can't help wondering;<br />
Will this hut perish or not?</p>
<p>Perishable or not, the original master is present,<br />
not dwelling south or north, east or west.<br />
Firmly based on steadiness, it can't be surpassed.<br />
A shining window below the green pines --<br />
Jade palaces or vermilion towers can't compare with it.</p>
<p>Just sitting with head covered, all things are at rest.<br />
Thus, this mountain monk doesn't understand at all.<br />
Living here he no longer works to get free.<br />
Who would proudly arrange seats, trying to entice guests?</p>
<p>Turn around the light to shine within, then just return.<br />
The vast inconceivable source can't be faced or turned away from.<br />
Meet the ancestral teachers, be familiar with their instruction,<br />
Bind grasses to build a hut, and don't give up.</p>
<p>Let go of hundreds of years and relax completely.<br />
Open your hands and walk, innocent.<br />
Thousands of words, myriad interpretations,<br />
Are only to free you from obstructions.<br />
If you want to know the undying person in the hut,<br />
Don't separate from this skin bag here and now.</p><br />
