No one would know that by looking at the amount or subject of content I produce, but it’s been in the back of my mind for a minute. I want to share more of what I’m doing creatively, and the reason for the hesitation is that doing so pretty much requires participation in the attention economy, opaque algorithms, terms of service that I haven’t read, and the forsaking of some amount of privacy and/or dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold the &lt;a href=&quot;https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory&quot;&gt;low tech web ring&lt;/a&gt;. See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://macwright.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; website and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eric-xia.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one. Although I’ve had a blog for many years it didn’t feel like much of a platform, and that’s because I didn’t treat it like one. It’s not as immediately gratifying as the socials, but I have so much more control, both in what the visitor sees, and what I am able to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I’ve gone and done on the backend is downgraded. I went from using WordPress to using Jekyll and GitHub pages. It’s more difficult to implement. There aren’t as many plug-ins available. But it’s fun, and instead of installing a theme and deleting most of the CSS I can write the code that I want to see. Yes this site looks and feels almost exactly like my old website, but just know there’s way more enthusiasm underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case I hope you enjoy the lack of ads and not needing another password to be here and participate. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="update" /><summary type="html">The past year or so, I’ve been very tepidly exploring avenues for sharing more online.

&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/w-back.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/w-back-th.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;wogglebug faceplate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it and how does it work you ask? Jesus I don&apos;t know. I know it sounds great though, and has that healthy-but-not-unwieldy amount of instability that I love. There are two oscillators and a third &quot;ring modulated&quot; output from them, two voltage-followy CVs from the oscillators, as well as an internal sample and hold out. You can modulate the clock and it has some great internal cross-modulation. See the Wiard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiard.com/modular/300series/wogglebug/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dual Wogglebug&lt;/a&gt; for a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

So having gone down this rabbit hole I&apos;m writing this now so that hopefully your jaunt down there isn&apos;t so fraught. I bought the PCB from &lt;a href=&quot;https://synthcube.com/cart/wiard-wogglebug-motm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;synthcube&lt;/a&gt; and started looking at schematics and mods. First there&apos;s the Grant Richter &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/w-standard-3.gif&quot;&gt;#3 standard&lt;/a&gt; schematic, then there&apos;s an update with some improvements (like buffered outputs--this one is what the MOTM PCB corresponds to). Then there&apos;s Dave Brown&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://modularsynthesis.com/bridechamber/wb/DJB%20Wogglebug%20schematics.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;corrected version&lt;/a&gt; of that redraw, some minor errors on the PCB, and those are all for +/-15V systems. Does your head hurt yet? Because then there&apos;s the Erica Synths &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/w-erica-redraw.pdf&quot;&gt;redraw&lt;/a&gt; which does have correct resistor values for +/-12V systems, but also includes some other errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

So here I&apos;ve redrawn it again! Just to make things more confusing. So this schematic and BOM apply to the MOTM format wiard wogglebug PCB currently sold by synthcube, and has correct resistor values for +/-12V power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Wogglebug &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/wogglebug_schem_redraw_2022.pdf&quot;&gt;Schematic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Corresponding &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/wogglebug_pcb_bom_redraw_2022.pdf&quot;&gt;BOM&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

R42 and R43 can serve as attenuators for the smooth and woggle CV output levels respectively. Linking these with wire (zero ohms) yields a signal from about 0-9V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The 3 numbers of the potentiometers correspond to their lug wiring. This isn&apos;t always clear on the PCB so you may have to follow some traces. Oh and I couldn&apos;t find this anywhere, but the board measures 3 7/8&quot; x 4 5/16&quot; (or 9.9cm x 10.9cm). It was a tight fit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;.&amp;emsp;.&amp;emsp;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

So that&apos;s what&apos;s up for building a standard wogglebug from the available PCB, and here are some additions and mods not present in the above docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Pugix made &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugix.com/synth/diy-wiard-wogglebug/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;his own wogglebug&lt;/a&gt; on protoboard with many interesting differences. I&apos;ve included the disturb circuit from him, an optional input (or two) that&apos;s mixed into the woggle range. I&apos;ve also added two LED drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I&apos;ve inverted the clock (outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://modularsynthesis.com/bridechamber/wb/wb.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://electro-music.com/forum/post-294519.html#294519&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and interrupted the sample and hold trace on the PCB with a switching jack and diode protection. It&apos;s helpful to put a 4.7nf capacitor from V1 lug 3 to ground also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I&apos;ve seen a couple people asking about making their own dual vactrol (the VTL5C3/2). Yes, it&apos;s very doable! Put two LDRs up against one LED and wire the LDRs in series. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/w-ldrs.jpeg&quot;&gt;Like this!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

So yeah, holy shit. Time to go touch grass. I really am grateful for all the different versions out there because I both pulled and learned from all of them. And to people talking it out on various forums from back when these things were cool (like 2008, ha). Anyway, go build one!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/l-face.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/l-face-th.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

If you want to fart around making noisy weird circuits go to the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://electro-music.com/forum/forum-160.html&quot;&gt;Lunetta forums&lt;/a&gt; over at electro-music.com and just start reading. It&apos;s a gold mine. I&apos;ve found immense inspiration from everyone posting there, from veterans who&apos;ve gone on to make careers out of this stuff to noobs asking about voltage regulator pinouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Given the amount of possibilities the modular approach was the only one that made sense for me. It kept my head from spinning. And since my 3U setup is mostly metal panels, and I have access to wood scraps, I thought I&apos;d give that a go. The patch points are made with bolts. Golds are ins and blacks are outs. I like the grid-like uniform look of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Buchla_100_series_at_NYU_%28edit1%29.jpg/1280px-Buchla_100_series_at_NYU_%28edit1%29.jpg&quot;&gt;Buchla 100 series&lt;/a&gt; and I thought if the panels were more wide than they are tall it would lend itself well to sequencers and the like, make it feel a bit more keyboardy for lack of a better term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/l-angle.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/l-angle-th.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/l-back.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022/l-back-th.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Anyway, phase #13 includes (clockwise from bottom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

- Six 40106 oscillators with a diode CV and a vactrol each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

- (Symetrically, from the outside in) two R2R ladders, two 4015 shift registers, and in the center is a 4040 clock divider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

- This is a goddamn rotary phone wired up to bolts. No soldering required. It&apos;s kind of gimmicky and very ridiculous and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

- Two LM358 lowpass filters. There are two frequency CVs and one vactrol resonance input each. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/l_filter.jpg&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s the schematic&lt;/a&gt;. I built a few filters and liked the sound of this one the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

- This is a 4051 sequencer with its own internal oscillator and diode CV input. Messing with the ABC inputs is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I don&apos;t have a ton to offer at the moment in terms of new circuits or ideas but here are a couple things I&apos;ve gleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

C pots or antilog pots work really well with 40106 oscillators. Because it oscillates based on the exponential charging and discharging of a capacitor an antilog pot gives a linear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Another tiny circuit I like a lot is making a little OR gate on inhibit inputs so you can have a &quot;trigger or gate&quot; response to the same pin. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2022/l_res_inh.jpg&quot;&gt;Like this!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the wild and free &lt;a href=&quot;http://ijfritz.byethost4.com/Chaos/ch_cir8_chaquo.htm&quot;&gt;ChaQuO&lt;/a&gt; module from the brain of Ian Fritz. There&apos;s the chaos circuit (Cha) and a quadrature--meaning four-output 90 degrees out of phase--sine wave LFO (QuO) which is normalled to the &quot;drive&quot; jack here. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-rxzmrd9j8&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a good demo. But nothing can compare to the off-the-chain intuitive play of these knobs. I&apos;m still getting to know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

So here we have some files for you to print and etch at home! These are shared with permission and are for non-commercial use only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I also highlighted the parts of the schematic that aren&apos;t on this circuit board in yellow &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/2021/chaquo-schem-w-panel-wiring.png&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if that&apos;s more your thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This module outputs rail-to-rail voltages, if that&apos;s a concern. Feel free to voltage drop them at the jacks or add attenuators or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Much gratitude to Ian Fritz! And happy building!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this is a fun module. It&apos;s one half of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sdiy.info/wiki/CGS_Serge_dual_universal_slope_generator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dual Universal Slope Generator&lt;/a&gt; (CGS114) with an added button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

There are a couple very simple patches over on the wiki which are great and easy to normalize. First is that the DC output can be normalled to the CV input, so when nothing&apos;s plugged in the CV attenuator knob changes the rise/fall shapes. There can also be a toggle switch to loop the slopes, LFO style, which connects the &quot;end out&quot; to &quot;trig in&quot; jacks. I left that one out. The button I added is momentary, wired to +5V (with a current-limiting resistor), and normalled to the input jack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In any case, one exciting thing for me is that this is my first time designing a toner transfer layout. A big upgrade from using sharpie. Shit can get a lot smaller and a lot more complicated, and I get a much better etch. It&apos;s a totally inelegant layout but I learned a ton. I&apos;m using inkscape which is probably also inelegant for this, but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The schematic I used is on the page linked above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
